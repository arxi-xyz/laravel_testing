## Answers to challenge

**Exercise**: Create a markdown file for a fictional Laravel blog application. Document:

1. The purpose of unit, feature, integration, and end-to-end tests.
2. A specific example of each test type for the blog app (e.g., testing a slug generator, a post creation route, or
   a comment submission flow).
3. How TDD could be applied to develop a feature like post categorization.
4. Why automated testing benefits the blog app’s long-term maintenance.

### The purpose of unit, feature, integration, and end-to-end tests.

These type of tests are called as functional testing and each of them aim to do a specific task.

1. Unit testing: unit testing means testing individual units or components of the application vai testing packages of
   language or framework.
2. feature testing: unlike unit test that try to test small unit of software feature test is focusing on testing a
   process like registering a user or creating a product in software
3. integration testing: these kind of test focus on testing the integration between different component or unit of
   software. in laravel feature test and integration test are like each other but feature test is more likely to a user
   behaviour but integration test aims to test the relation between different parts(e.g. the connection between database
   and code and redis).
4. end-to-end testing: end-to-end testing is a bit bigger that feature and integration testing. in these type of test
   we try to simulate the behaviour of user, and it whole system from UI to database layer (you can use laravel Dusk
   package for it). you open
   pages fill the inputs submit check result and other stuffs.

### A specific example of each test type for the blog app (e.g., testing a slug generator, a post creation route, ora comment submission flow).

### How TDD could be applied to develop a feature like post categorization.

First of all lets define what the TDD is. TDD (Test Driven Development) is cycle that describe write test first then
implement coding and after that you can refactor it. You can develop different features first by implementing tests.
test are describing what is the feature and how it must be looked like. we write test until it give enough structure for
feature. then we start to write code for passing the test and after that we look for some mistake we have done and tryto
refactor them.

### Why automated testing benefits the blog app’s long-term maintenance.

By automated testing we can ensure that all part of software is working. testing gives developers enough courage to
change and develop the application because they know that there is some code that check hole application and this helps
to maintain the application better and of course easier.
